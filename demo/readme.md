# Neon White Demo Autosplitter

The accompanying `neonwhitedemo.asl` file is an autosplitter for the Neon White Demo, released as part of the 2021 Steam Next Fest. The demo is no longer available through Steam - consider [purchasing the full game](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1533420/Neon_White/) instead.

## Important Information!!!

* **SINCE THE FULL GAME HAS RELEASED, THIS AUTOSPLITTER WILL NO LONGER BE MAINTAINED.**
* When using IGT, there may be small discrepancies between your level time in LiveSplit and your level time in the game (up to 2/100 of a second).
    * These discrepancies are because of how the game keeps track of time internally.
* The autosplitter assumes you are **NOT** playing on a new file. **Play on a save file with the 18 main missions already unlocked.**
* The autosplitter uses both RTA ("Real Time Attack") and IGT ("In Game Time"). You can choose which one to compare in LiveSplit:
    * Right-click on LiveSplit > "Compare Against" > "Real Time" / "Game Time"
